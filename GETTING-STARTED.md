# New student guide

Brace yourself: you're about to make a bold step into what many say is both the most challenging and most rewarding thing they've 
ever done. You've got an incredible opportunity to cover a *ton* of ground in three short months; what you get out of this time is 
going to be directly related to what you put into it. Get ready to have some fun.

## Prework

We've got a tremendous amount of ground to cover and will be dedicating the majority of our time to deeply understanding Javascript 
and the ecosystem around the language; it'll dramatically improve your ability to keep up if you're generally familiar with important 
tools like HTML, CSS, Git, and the command line prior to the start of class; we'll be making regular use of all of these.

I've put together [this short online book](https://tiy-charlotte.gitbooks.io/frontend/content/) that covers these topics and a few 
more that you should read from end to end before the first day of class. You should also complete the free version of the 
[Code Academy course on HTML and CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) prior to the first day of class. The goal here isn't to 
have you memorize each and every command, tag, property, etc, but to start to understand what these various tools are used for and how 
to interact with them. Mastery will come with time :wink:

## Teamwork and communication

You should expect to use other students as a resource and be one yourself. We strongly encourage collaboration in the interest of 
personal growth, and you should expect to work with many different classmates throughout the three months, both formally and informally.

Once you've been accepted, you'll be able to join our [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel we'll use for everyday communication. Introduce 
yourself, get to know each other, and feel free to ask or answer questions related to the prework.
