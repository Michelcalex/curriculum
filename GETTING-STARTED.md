# New student guide

Brace yourself: you're about to make a bold step into what many say is both the most challenging and most rewarding thing they've 
ever done. You've got an incredible opportunity to cover a *ton* of ground in three short months; what you get out of this time is 
going to be directly related to what you put into it. Get ready to have some fun.

## Prework

We've got a tremendous amount of ground to cover and will be dedicating the majority of our time to deeply understanding Javascript 
and the ecosystem around the language; it'll dramatically improve your ability to keep up if you're generally familiar with important 
tools like HTML, CSS, Git, and the command line prior to the start of class; we'll be making regular use of all of these.

I've put together [this short online book](https://tiy-charlotte.gitbooks.io/frontend/content/) that covers these topics and a few 
more that you should read from end to end before the first day of class. You should also complete the free version of the 
[Code Academy course on HTML and CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) prior to the first day of class. The goal here isn't to 
have you memorize each and every command, tag, property, etc, but to start to understand what these various tools are used for and how 
to interact with them. Mastery will come with time :wink:

## Teamwork and communication

You should expect to use other students as a resource and be one yourself. We strongly encourage collaboration in the interest of 
personal growth, and you should expect to work with many different classmates throughout the three months, both formally and informally.

Once you've been accepted, you'll be able to join our [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel we'll use for everyday communication. Introduce 
yourself, get to know each other, and feel free to ask or answer questions related to the prework.

## Assignments

**You will receive and submit assignments from The Iron Yard Online (TIYO) throughout the course, but all code will be hosted on Github** This will help you reach mastery with git and also make it easy for both instructors and students to track progress over time.

Assignments are intended to be difficult and we expect you to have to spend lab time and several hours after lab each day to complete them. The core content of the course is incremental, and each assignment is designed to apply the new concepts or principles of the day as well as reiterate content we've previously covered.

### Assessments
I'll try my best to provide meaningful feedback on your assignments in a timely matter. We'll also dedicate classtime to going over hard concepts or problem areas, and I'm happy to review things 1:1 during lab time as well.

We don't give traditional 'grades' at the Iron Yard; when you submit an assignment you will receive one of four responses:

* **Exceeded expectations:** you knocked it out of the park!
* **Complete and satisfactory:** you accomplished the core elements of the assignment to a satisfactory level. Nice work!
* **Incomplete:** you were missing important parts from your assignment. Please resubmit.
* **Complete and unsatisfactory:** incomplete without the opportunity to resubmit. Hopefully rare, and generally reserved for cases where the code wasn't the core problem (i.e. cheating).

Like most things, you'll get out what you put in. All else being equal, you should strive for mostly *complete and satisfactory* labels, but don't panic if you get an incomplete (just don't make it a habit or you risk making the remainder of the class unmanageable).

## A day in the life
Each day will have two primary components: lecture in the morning, and lab after lunch. Lecture will last for three hours (with occasional breaks), will cover a particular topic, and end with a practice assignment. Lab will be mostly open time for you to work on the assignment. Lab officially runs until 5pm but you're welcome to stay later if you'd like. You should plan to stay at the Iron Yard until at least 5pm every day.

### Weekly schedule

**Monday through Thursday** of each week will be intensive classroom and lab days. Every evening I'll post some notes for the day on TIYO, and after lecture I'll post code from class in the [curriculum](https://github.com/TIY-Charlotte-Frontend-Engineering/curriculum) repository. You'll have three hours (9am - noon) of instruction, followed by lab time in the afternoon. I'll be around during this time though the primary goal is for you to practice and apply the lessons from the day with provided assignments or project work.

I'll typically be available in person until around 5pm, and will try to be available remotely during the evening if needed. You should expect to have an assignment due every night; Thursday assignments will be bigger but will not be due until Sunday night.

**Fridays** have two goals: dedicated working time for you to chip away at the weekend assignment and catch up on weekly topics, and taking a step back to look at the bigger picture of software development. The exact format is TBD and will likely evolve, but we'll usually have a large block of time for you to work alongside classmates and instructors as well as:

- Presentations from guest speakers who may be from the local industry (corporate, startups, incubators, etc), work with dev tools (Github), or other relevant topics
- Deep dive on a powerful tool (gulp, browserify, normalize.css, etc) or important computing topic that will make you a better developer
- Q&A with recruiters on how to put together effective technical resumes, portfolios, etc

Every Friday we'll also celebrate the conclusion of the week with Iron Pints; we'll head downstairs to the new pub in Packard Place and enjoy each others' company with drinks on the Iron Yard for those who are interested.

### Lecture topics
You can find the most up-to-date list of lecture topics [on the README.md for this repo](https://github.com/TIY-Charlotte-Frontend-Engineering/curriculum). Note that this is all subject to change based on pacing, and slip room is built-in at several points. The exact timing of when we cover a particular topic is TBD; if we need to move more slowly through a harder topic then we can do that. The overall set of topics and general ordering should paint a reliable picture of what we'll be covering throughout the course.

### Final projects
The final two to three weeks will be dedicated to a final group project; these weeks will be largely unstructured collaboration time. You'll be forming and working in groups to develop something that you'll demo at graduation at Demo Day to potential employers, classmates, etc. You'll have a high degree of freedom in what you choose to build.

Expect to use everything you've learned during the class (and likely things you'll have to pick up on your own) for your final project; it'll be the crowning item in your new portfolio so expect to put quite a bit of time into it.
