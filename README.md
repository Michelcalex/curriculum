# Frontend engineering @ Charlotte

Welcome to the Iron Yard! It's great to have you on board and I'm excited to work with you over the coming months. This site is your 
one-stop shop for information before, during, and after the course and will contain everything from class policies to code submissions.

**Before class**

1. Check out the [new student guide](GETTING-STARTED.md) to learn more about what to expect and what you can do to ensure you're prepared.
2. Do the [required prework](GETTING-STARTED.md#Prework); it's required because it'll help soften the rampup and ensure we're all starting from a level playing field.
3. Read over the [class policies](POLICIES.md).
4. If you'd like, you can read up on [how assignments work](GETTING-STARTED.md#Assignments) and what you'll be learning.
5. Create an account on [Github](https://github.com) and join [our class group](https://github.com/TIY-Charlotte-Frontend-Engineering).

**During class**

1. I'll be taking attendence every day, and recording both tardies and absences. We're strict on attendence because we need to move quickly
to cover everything, and waiting around isn't an option. See the [class policies](POLICIES.md) for more details.
2. All code that we go over in class will be available in this Github repository. You're welcome to keep anything we've done after the class 
is over (though we do ask that you don't share video, etc with people who are not students).
3. I've put together a short write-up describing [a day in the life](GETTING-STARTED.md#A_day_in_the_life) while class is underway.

**After class**

All of the code you've written is your code, and you can take anything we've done in or for class away with you (code, videos, assignments,
etc). We hope to stay in touch afterwards and help you grow your career so stay in touch!
