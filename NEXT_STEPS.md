## Congrats on a job well done!

I hope you're proud of how much you've accomplished over the past three months. We've had a chance to cover a lot of important ideas together but even more important than the class time is what you do after it. Take a well-deserved break but don't forget that this is the takeoff, not the landing, and there are a lot of great technologies, groups, projects, and other resources that can help you develop your skills.

The goal of this guide is to provide some topics and resources for self-study that I'd recommend based on what you've learned so far. The first second is for stuff you *really should do* to keep your core strong, and the second is a buffet-style bucket of things that will help you broaden your knowledge beyond the core.

Stay in touch!

### SHOULD do

- PRACTICE. Write code at least a few days a week. It doesn't matter what you do. Do old homeworks. Work on a project by yourself. Do practice problems and then throw them away. Use it or you'll lose it, and you've worked too hard for that.

- Get more practice with **responsive layouts**. Foundation is popular these days, but [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/) are pretty popular as well. If you can't get paid for it, practice reimplementing pages on [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/) or building your own website.

- Listen to other people talking about development. For frontend in particular I'd recommend the [Javascript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber) podcast, the [You Don't Know JS book series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), [A List Apart blog](http://alistapart.com/), and the bible of responsive web design, mysteriously named [Responsive Web Design](https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design). I would try your best to [attend meetups](http://www.meetup.com/), and stay active within the Iron Yard community (including meeting alumni who have been working for a bit).

- Pick up a side project; I'd recommend starting with a personal portfolio site. Think through the design and content, throw it up on Surge or Github pages, and consider ordering a custom domain (`yourname.com`). Even once you're working it's a good idea to keep a side project alive because it'll allow you to continue to learn outside of the constraints of your work.

### MIGHT do

- Consider trying out a different **MVC framework** - you've got plenty to choose from. [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) (or React Native for mobile apps) is the hotness now, and React's design pushes you to write modular code (a Good Thing). [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) is brand new but looks flippin' awesome, and introduces other great patterns like type safety (see Typescript below) and [reactive patterns](http://blog.angular-university.io/functional-reactive-programming-for-angular-2-developers-rxjs-and-observables/). [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is delightfully simple. [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) is heavily functional and leads to some of the highest code quality in the land. [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) is also new and supposedly very good.

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html) is one of the best recent developments in the Javascript ecosystem IMO. It allows you to write Javascript with *explicit type annotations* (you state what type each variable should have, and gulp or an alternative tool tells you when you break the rules). I personally find that I write much clearer and easier-to-debug code with Typescript than vanilla JS.

- Try another language, or NodeJS!

- Functional programming practice

### Technologies I love

- Typescript
- Immutable JS
