# Policies and Code of Conduct
The Academy is dedicated to providing a harassment-free educational experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. The Academy does not tolerate harassment of students in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Academy venue. A student violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the Academy.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of lectures or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Students asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Please conduct yourself with respect for the others in your class. This should be considered a workplace, with no room for NSFW material. If you find yourself about to do or say something which could reasonably be considered offensive, stop. Likewise, if you hear or see something which could reasonably be interpreted as either offensive or benign, try to assume that other people mean no harm. That being said, if something said or done to you, about you, or around you offends you or makes you uncomfortable, please feel free to inform a staff member immediately. If you do not feel comfortable speaking to a local staffer, you can reach out to headquarters - everyone in the company is on Slack, and our email addresses are publicly available.

**We believe firmly in the dignity of everyone on our team, and students are a part of that team.**

## Your Instructor: Luke Segars ([schedule](https://calendly.com/luke-segars/discuss))

Originally from South Carolina, Luke is returning to the east coast after three years as a product manager at Google in order to find the intersection of his two favorite topics: teaching and building things. He spent a long time in school, earning both his bachelors and masters in computer science, but has also been an avid side project enthusiast since graduating. During grad school he taught a course for budding computer scientists and realized how accessible and fun coding could be for others and has been excited about it ever since. While not at work, Luke can usually be found overcommitting himself to various shenanigans, including but certainly not limited to scuba diving, video games, writing, and improv.

Luke started coding about twelve years ago; despite his formal education, he's mostly taught himself web development and almost always has a side project of some kind going on. He's familiar with a number of different languages, including C, C++, Java, Go, Python, Matlab, and Javascript.

### Instructor Office Hours
Instructors are generally available during the lab hours noted in the daily schedule, however responsibilities outside of classroom activities may reduce that availability. During office hours your instructors will be available to help you in person. You may be able to ask questions via Slack outside these times, but there’s no guarantee. If you'd like to schedule a dedicated session with one of your instructors, please use the schedule links provided.

Please ask questions, but keep in mind that un-researched questions will be redirected towards research. When you ask a question, be prepared to present the research materials that you've gathered and your thoughts on those materials. Come to your instructors in pairs or groups whenever possible.

## How will I be evaluated?
We’re going to treat you like the grown-up you are when it comes to your class commitment. With that said, however, we have a system that ensures that you stay on track. We outline Charlotte's specific evaluation process [here](https://github.com/TIY-Charlotte-Frontend-Engineering/curriculum/blob/new-readme/GETTING-STARTED.md#assignments).

The Iron Yard uses a Pass/Fail grading system for assignments, and completion of the program is contingent upon a demonstrated proficiency of the curriculum as presented to your instructor.

Instructors will evaluate student performance with the campus director on a weekly basis. If the weekly evaluation shows that a student is having trouble, instructors and the campus director may meet with the student to discuss unsatisfactory progress and determine steps to improve performance.

If instructors and the campus director do not see improvement after two meetings with a student regarding performance, that student may be asked to leave the current program.

If you disagree with an evaluation, you may contact your instructor, the campus director, or file a complaint consistent with the procedures outlined under the section titled **Complaints**.

Please note: You may not re-enroll in the same program semester if you dropout, or are asked to leave. You must apply for a new program, and follow the same entrance requirements as if you are a new student.

## Absences and Tardies

Being late to the beginning of class is disruptive not only to you, but to your classmates. If you know that you will be late to a lecture, give your instructor reasonable notice prior to the class commencing. If you are late to a lecture, and did not give your instructor notice, it will be up to the Instructor’s discretion whether to count you as tardy.

- If you are determined to have two (2) tardies in one (1) week, it will be counted as an absence.
- If you miss more than four (4) lectures, or tally more than four (4) absences, it will be difficult for you to keep up with the course content, and it will be difficult for us to provide a strong recommendation for you during job placement.

We will have ongoing discussions with anyone falling behind to determine the appropriate adjustments needed to get back on track, or to potentially part ways if recovery is unlikely.

However, we understand that conflicts arise. Just talk to us and let us know what’s going on as early as possible so we can make sure you are keeping up with the course and getting your work done. You will not be allowed to make-up any of the missed attendance.

## Holidays

We'll announce holidays that will affect the pacing of the cohort during the first week of class. If you observe additional holidays and have concerns about the potential impact on your experience, please contact the campus director and your instructor.

## Graduation requirements

Students understand that in order to graduate from the program and to receive a Certificate of Completion, they must successfully complete the required number of scheduled clock hours as specified in the catalog and on the Student Enrollment Agreement, satisfactorily pass assignments and satisfy all financial obligations to the School.

## Complaints

The Iron Yard strives to offer an amazing experience to prepare you for a career in the professional software development world. If you have any complaints, please send an email detailing the situation to your instructor and campus director and we will make our best attempt to resolve your issue. If escalation is necessary, the Director of Instruction and the Director of Global Campus Operations will make the final decision on any potential resolution to your issue.
